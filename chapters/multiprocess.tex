			\textbf{Thread} & Shared address space between threads & Threads can easily communicate between each other via the shared variables & Threads are easily created and destroyed & Threads can exercise considerable control over threads of the same process & Changes to the main thread (cancellation, priority change, etc.) may affect the behavior of the other threads of the process \\ \hline
			\textbf{Process} & Independent address space between processes & Proesses can communicate via considerable overhead with O.S. interprocess communication & Processess require duplication of the parent process & Processes can only exercise control over child processes. & Changes to the parent process do not affect child processes \\ \hline

\section{Operations on processes}

\subsection{fork()}
This command creates a process by duplicating the calling process.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
pid_t child_pid; 

child_pid = fork();

if (child_pid != 0)
	printf("Parent: child's process id = %d\n", child_pid);
else
	printf("Child: my process id = %d\n", (int) getpid()); printf
\end{lstlisting}

When forking a process:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Parent process virtual address space is replicated in the child, Including the states of variables, mutexes, condition variables, POSIX objects.
	\item The child inherits copies of the parent's set of open file descriptors, as well as status fags and current file offset.
\end{itemize}
