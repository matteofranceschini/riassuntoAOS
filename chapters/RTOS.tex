\section{Types}
There are two types of RTOS:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Hard real-time}: timing violation is not accettable (car, ecc..)
	\item \textbf{Soft real-time}: timing violation is undesiderable but accettable (video, music, ecc..)
\end{itemize}

\section{Features}
The main features of an RTOS are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Determinism}: operation are performed at fixed and predetermined times \textbf{or} within predetermined time intervals. It defines how much time it takes to react, but \textbf{not} to complete the operation (i.e. how long does it take to handle and interrupt).
	\item \textbf{Resposiveness}: how long, after acknowledgement, the operating system takes to \textbf{service} (complete) the task (i.e. the interrupt). It depends on ISR nesting.
	\item \textbf{Reliability}: degradation of performances should not impact the system:	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Fail soft: Ability to fail in such a way to preserve as much data
		\item Stability: the system adopts policies such that the most critical high priority tasks execute first, even if some needs of less important tasks cannot be met.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Algorithms}
The major scheduling algorithms are listed in Table \ref{tab:RTOS_scheduling}

			\textbf{Algorithm} & \textbf{Schedulability analysis} & \textbf{Static/Dynamic} & \textbf{Advantages} & \textbf{Issues} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
			Earliest Deadline First & YES, online & DYNAMIC & Easy & Executing a task that could not met the deadline may prevent other tasks to reach their deadlines and the number of tasks that will miss the deadline is unpredictable. & Through a static analysis of the tasks determines, at run time, when a task has to be executed (applicable to periodic tasks). \\ \hline
			Rate Monotonic & YES, offline & STATIC & Simpler than EDF, if the formula is valid, ensures we will never miss a deadline. & It's not always possible to achieve maximum CPU utilization & Every task has a priority, shortest period task highest priority and therefore is executed first. \\ \hline
			Dynamic Planning Based & YES, online & DYNAMIC & A task is accepted for execution if and only if is feasible to meet its time constraints & Quite complicate to implement & Before a task execution an attempt is made to create a schedule including previous tasks and the new one. \\ \hline
			Dynamic Best Effort & NO & DYNAMIC & Easy, no analysis & Some deadlines may be misssed & The system tries to meed dedlines and aborts any started process whose deadline is missed. Until the task is completed or the deadline arrives, it is unknown if time constraints will be met. \\ \hline

			\textbf{EDF} & HIGH, real time raise priority to task with earlier deadline & HIGH, process are preempted continuously $sum{\frac{C_i}{T_i}} \le 1$, (max 100\%) & if system is overloaded the set of process that fail deadline are large and unpredictable \\ \hline
