\section{Criteria}
Algorithms can be optimized for different goal (WTFCRT)
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Waiting time}, amount of time a process has been waiting in the ready queue
\item \textbf{Turnaround time}, amount of time to execute a particular process
\item \textbf{Fairness}, defines if every process can, eventually, have its needed CPU time
\item \textbf{CPU utilization}, keep CPU as busy as possible
\item \textbf{Response time}, amount of time it takes from when a request was submitted until the first response is produce, not output.
\item \textbf{Throughput}, number of processes that complete their execution per time unit.


\end{itemize}

\section{Multilevel Queue}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{\textbf{multilevel queue}}, the scheduler select the queue for a process according to its type. Process does not change its queue
	\item{\textbf{multilevel feedback queue}}, process starts in the first queue but if do not complete after the first execution scheduler in the next queue
\end{itemize}

\section{Exectution Time Extimation}
	Some scheduling algorithms (SJB, SRTN, HRRN) needs to know their execution time to be implemented.
	A possibile extimation is done with this formula:
	\begin{equation}
		tau_{n+1} = \alpha t_n + (1 - \alpha) \tau_n
	\end{equation}
	with:\\
	$\alpha (0 < \alpha < 1): $ weight coefficient\\
	$t_n:$ current execution time\\
	$\tau_n:$ extimation of the current execution time\\
	$\tau_{n+1}:$ extimation of the next execution time

		\hline
		& \textbf{COMPLEXITY} & \textbf{OVERHEAD} & \textbf{CPU UTILIZATION} & \textbf{ISSUES} \\ \hline
		\textbf{MASTER/ SLAVE} & LOW, there is a master processor that manage the ready process queue and the common resources & LOW, static assignament of process there are few content switch & LOW, a low demanding task can lock a cpu & the master core is the bottle neck of the system\\ \hline
		
		\textbf{PEER} & HIGH, every processor has its own scheduler that have to race for common resources & HIGH, the same process can start in a processor and then jump to another & HIGH &high complexity in shared resources management \\ \hline

\end{table}

\section{Content Switch}
is a particular state of OS in which the current process in execution is stopped, the context (value of the program counter and of the register) is saved in PCB (process control bock) to allow to conitnue the execution on the future and is set the context of the new process selected from the ready queue by the scheduler.\\
\textbf{When it occours:} \\
\begin{itemize}
		\item in multitasking execution
		\item when an interrupt occours
		\item switching from kernel mode to user mode (in some architectures the cost of this operation can be lower than the other two cases)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{hardware implementation:} \\
a content switch can be implemented \underline{explicitly} with a CALL or JMP instruction to the TSS (task state segment) in global descriptor table\\
or \underline{implicitly} by hardware support that when an interrupt occours automatically save the context in special shadow registers and execute the task according to the interrupt descriptor table.\\
Sometime there can be some limitation to the hardware approach that depends from the archiecture, for example in some case the registers used by the task can be different from the general pourpose regiser of shadow reg and a software approach would be better.
